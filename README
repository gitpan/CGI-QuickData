=head1 NAME

CGI::QuickData - Perl module to provide quick CGI forms for database tables. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

NB This is alpha code - it is fully functional but I<not> feature-complete.

There is no documentation - however two working examples are provided
for the time being.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To follow. Very similar to QuickForm - builds upon it, but with more options.

=head1 BUGS

Incomplete. This may be a wrong direction which binds the user interface and
the database interface too tightly together leading to an inflexible module.
Basically it's useful for generically working with tables but has no provision
for cross-table relationships.
