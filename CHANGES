Have added a new example which provides generic access to a databases tables
with minimal programer intervention. This module should be useful for generic
access to tables, (in conjunction with example2), but is probably too narrow
in scope to be acceptable for end-users. Nonetheless it could serve as a
template for more application-specific programs.

Corrected bug in WHERE clause handling when reordering the List view.
Corrected bug that showed a param when going to the Find view.
Added -HEADER and -FOOTER options.
Now pass through -LANGUAGE, -SIZE, -MAXLENGTH, -ROWS and -COLUMNS to
QuickForm's show_form.
Minor fixes/improvements.
